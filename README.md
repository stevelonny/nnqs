# Neural Net Quantum States

Investigation into Neural Nets usage as Quantum States in Many-Body Quantum Problems.

This project is made for the Deep Learning with Applications course @ UNIMI in A.Y. 2025 - 2026 . I am presenting the following article: []() with a demo on ground state search.

## Project outline
**Ground state search:** Quantum state are represented by neural nets, which will be trained with a Variational Monte Carlo approach.
